## challenge - What's in the name!

This was the challenge description:

*Find Pratyaksh06 & get the flag.

Note: The flag doesn't contain any domain name part of email like @gmail.com . Fetch only the username part of the email.*

Right, we have a possible username. My normal online got to app is:

https://whatsmyname.app/

This highlights a number of accounts. I'll check out the main ones first.

- Twitter 
- Github 

They look intetesting so let's check those accounts out. 

Remember you can search for names as well as conversations.

Some further research on how to find email addresses from the social media sites you checked will help, although some of the methods may be a bit patchy, stick with it to get the flag. :)
