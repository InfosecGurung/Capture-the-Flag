# challenge - I hate chemistry but I love the metals

This was the challenge description:

*]45;;482?3*

The hint provided was:

*AUthentication, Authorization & Encryption will save you from many Bugs.**

So the first thing that pops into my head is the capitalisation of the hint. The first AU, if used inconjunction with the challenge title provides you with an element name.

If I then search for a cipher for this element #boom 

I'll leave the rest up to you :)
