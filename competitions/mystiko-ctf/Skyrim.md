## challenge - Skyrim

This was the challenge description:

*"Skyrim belongs to the Nords and i am .......... . Sorry lass, I’ve got important things to do. We’ll speak another time."*

A story is told in this description. I did some searching for Skyrim as the name was familiar.

*The game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in **Skyrim**, the northernmost province of Tamriel.*

With this in mind I did a quick search for: 
```

https://www.dcode.fr/en

This is a great site for all things code based (especially graphical based challenges). The Google search came up with a few good choices. All I had to do was check them out against the image we were supplied and we got the flag.

I will admit to doing some reverse image searches with Google and Yandex, but there were two many choices. It was at this stage I went back and reviewed the description and got back on track.
