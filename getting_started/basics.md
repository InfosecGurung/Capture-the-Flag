Depending on how much base knowledge you have I recommend the following (and in that order if you can).

Now learning can be boring so can to a certain degree mix and match the list below:

1. Join the HTB Academy

2. Complete the following modules (all tier 0, so free in effect):

   1. Intro to Academy
   2. Linux Fundamentals
   3. Getting Started
   4. Introduction to Networking
   5. Windows Fundamentals

3. Starting Point Boxes (13 free; 10 require a subscription)

   1. Each box provides a learning point, that you will be tested against and as part of that knowledge transfer provides a walk through to assist.
   2. The first box "Meow"  introduces:
      1. ping
      2. nmap
      3. telnet

4. Once you have completed these boxes, I recommend you do them again!!

5. This time use your own notes to complete the boxes.

6. There are a number of note taking tools but I fully recommend  https://obsidian.md/

   1. This is in markdown language, which is an amazing simple way of creating great looking documents and notes.
   2. That being the case take some time to learn how to use it effectively. Lots of youtube videos.

7. Virtual Machines

   1. I recommend Virtualbox by Oracle. https://www.virtualbox.org/
   2. I recommend you use the pre-built kali virtual machines. https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines

8. Additional resources that I use:
   1. Look at the Bandit series first, will help with Linux; fantastic challenges. https://overthewire.org/wargames/
   2. Similar to HTB, THM - great pathways and enough free boxes/rooms to help you learn the basics. https://tryhackme.com/
   3. 24/7 CTFs - with hundreds of challenges in their "picogym" all go towards improving your skills as you attack boxes. https://picoctf.org/

9. Programming Languages, either look at the amazing free youtube training videos or maybe purchase online courses. They all do the same thing. Get a basic understanding of what they are, what they do, and what you can do to use them:
   1. Python
   2. Javascript/Java/JS
   3. Php
   4. Bash
